This project was developed for the CU Software Engineering along the semester and consisted of doing four sprints, each one focused on certain aspects, as listed below. The project language is java and 6 modules: activity, bank, broker, car, hotel and tax. Each module takes a set of functions and together they provide an adventure to the client.

There exists in this repository 4 four branches, with each one having the work done for each sprint, being the topics of each spring listed below:

### Objective:
Migrated some more tests and implemented new tests from JUnit to Spock Framework, but this time using Mocks and variable injection

## 3rd Deliver

### Tools:

### Objective:
Made changes to core code, and implemented a new functionality across the different modules.

## 4th Deliver
